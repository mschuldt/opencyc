<H2>What is an <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab.html#ActorSlot>#$ActorSlot</a>?</H2>

<p>

Actor slots are the predicates that Cyc uses to express relationships
between an event and the participants in it (in other systems similar
things are called participant roles, (deep) case roles or thematic
relations).  Because an actor slot is a binary relation, the
collection <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab.html#ActorSlot>#$ActorSlot</a> (the collection of all actor slots) is a
subcollection of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#BinaryPredicate>#$BinaryPredicate</a>.  The first argument of an actor
slot is an instance of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/time-vocab.html#Event>#$Event</a>; the second is an instance of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/time-vocab.html#SomethingExisting>#$SomethingExisting</a>.  For example, the assertion (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/financial-vocab.html#buyer>#$buyer</a>
#$BikeBuying001 #$Kim) means that in the <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/financial-vocab.html#Buying>#$Buying</a> event
#$BikeBuying001, the buyer is #$Kim.  The assertion (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#objectPaidFor>#$objectPaidFor</a>
#$BikeBuying001 #$Vitus002) means that #$Vitus002 is the bike that is
purchased in #$BikeBuying001, and so on.

<p>

Currently (July, 1997), there are about a hundred actor slots used
in Cyc (you can view the <A HREF="actor-vocab-complete.html">complete
list</A>).  Because there are so many, their use is at times
bewildering.  This note discusses the hierarchy of actor slots and
what criteria are used to define an actor slot's meaning.

<p>

Some slots are very specific (like <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#vehicle>#$vehicle</a>); others quite broad
(like <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#objectMoving>#$objectMoving</a>).  It is useful to have actor slots of varying
degrees of specificity, because we need to express genralizations
about broad and narrow classes of participants in events.  There are
many events in which it makes sense to talk about an <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#objectMoving>#$objectMoving</a>,
and in some subset of those events we can additionally characterize
that participant as a <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#vehicle>#$vehicle</a> (a device that moves under its own
power and transports people or goods).  Thus, although it may seem
that there are an excessive number of actor slots, each one is
motivated by the need to express certain statements in the knowledge
base, and they are organized in a hierarchical way, with more specific
actor slots inheriting information from more general ones.

<p>

<H2>The organization of the <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab.html#ActorSlot>#$ActorSlot</a> hierarchy</H2>

<p>

Actor slots are arranged in a hierarchy.  Since they are predicates,
not collections, the relation that holds between a more general and a
more specific actor slot is <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genlPreds>#$genlPreds</a>.  For example, (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genlPreds>#$genlPreds</a>
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#vehicle>#$vehicle</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#transporter>#$transporter</a>) means that the actor slot <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#vehicle>#$vehicle</a> is a
specialization of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#transporter>#$transporter</a>.  By arranging actor slots in a
hierarchy, we can economically represent knowledge about a large and
diverse set of participant roles.  Everything we know to be true of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#transporter>#$transporter</a>s, for example, will also be true of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#vehicle>#$vehicle</a>s, and
every participant in an event that is deemed a <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#vehicle>#$vehicle</a> is also a
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#transporter>#$transporter</a>.  One type of information that <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#vehicle>#$vehicle</a> inherits from
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#transporter>#$transporter</a> is its argument types.  The first argument of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#transporter>#$transporter</a> must be an instance of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#TransportationEvent>#$TransportationEvent</a>, so the
first argument of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#vehicle>#$vehicle</a> must be a specialization of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#TransportationEvent>#$TransportationEvent</a>.  As we can see, the first argument of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#vehicle>#$vehicle</a>
is an instance of #$TransportationUsingADevice.  The second argument
of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#transporter>#$transporter</a> must be an instance of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#SolidTangibleThing>#$SolidTangibleThing</a>, and the
second argument of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#vehicle>#$vehicle</a> must be an instance of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#TransportationDevice-Vehicle>#$TransportationDevice-Vehicle</a>, a subset of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#SolidTangibleThing>#$SolidTangibleThing</a>.

<p>

The most general actor slot is called <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#actors>#$actors</a>.  In other words, for
any participant ?X in an event ?E we can assert, at a minimum,
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#actors>#$actors</a> ?E ?X).  Hopefully, we can say something more specific than
that about a participant's role in an event, but <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#actors>#$actors</a> does impose
some restrictions.  Most importantly, the participant and the event
must "temporally intersect"; i.e., the participant has to exist while
the event is happening.

<p> 

As we look at more specialized actor slots the restrictions increase.
Most commonly, the restrictions involve more specialized argument type
constraints on both the kind of event that a slot makes sense for, and
the kind of object that can participate in a given fashion.  Thus the
actor slot <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#transporter>#$transporter</a> can be sensibly used only with reference to
participants in <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#TransportationEvent>#$TransportationEvent</a>s that are capable of motion.

<p>

Other kinds of assertions differentiate actor slots from one
another as well.  <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#preActors>#$preActors</a> is a specialization of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#actors>#$actors</a> for
participants that pre-exist the event.  So things that are changed by
an event, like a house being painted in a #$Painting event, are
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#preActors>#$preActors</a> in that event, while things that are created in the course
of an event, like a house being built in a #$BuildingConstructing
event, are not <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#preActors>#$preActors</a> in that event.  There is also the actor
slot <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#postActors>#$postActors</a>, for participants that exist after an event; a house
that gets painted or otherwise modified is one of the <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#postActors>#$postActors</a>,
but a house that gets dismantled or demolished in an event is not.
You will often see pairs of actor slots in the hierarchy like
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#preActors>#$preActors</a> and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#postActors>#$postActors</a>, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#deliberateActors>#$deliberateActors</a> and
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#nonDeliberateActors>#$nonDeliberateActors</a>, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#inputs>#$inputs</a> and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#outputs>#$outputs</a>, and so on.

<p>

If you're interested in seeing actor slots hierarchically arranged by
their <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genlPreds>#$genlPreds</a> relations to one another, you can view this
<A HREF="actor-vocab-tree.html">Actor Slot Hierarchy</A>.

<p>

<H2>Is the current set of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab.html#ActorSlot>#$ActorSlot</a>s final and unchangeable?</H2>

<p>

The existing set of actor slots should not be regarded as complete or
definitive.  However, a considerable amount of organized effort has been
put into the current inventory and arrangement of actor slots, so
modifying the use of old ones or adding new ones without some thought is
discouraged.

<p>

As a rough generalization, we want to have different actor slots
available for each of the different kinds of participants in an event.
Sometimes we can get around this without creating new actor slots
because there are other ways besides actor slots of telling one
participant from another.  For example, given the assumption that
there is one bride and one groom in a #$Wedding, we can use the actor
slot <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#eventHonors>#$eventHonors</a> to refer to either one, and distinguish the bride
as a member of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#AdultFemalePerson>#$AdultFemalePerson</a>.  So we don't necessarily need
actor slots for bride and groom.

<p>

New actor slots will be created for a couple of reasons.  Particularly
at the more specific level, we may find, as more knowledge is entered
into the system, that there is a need to distinguish two participants
that current actor slots don't serve to distinguish.  Also, a new
actor slot may be created for the sake of convenience and efficiency
in inference, if we find the same combination of literals used in rule
after rule to designate a particular participant in a type of event.
As one example, the actor slot <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#vehicle>#$vehicle</a> refers to a
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#TransportationDevice-Vehicle>#$TransportationDevice-Vehicle</a> which is both the
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#providerOfMotiveForce>#$providerOfMotiveForce</a> and the <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#transporter>#$transporter</a> in a
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#TransportationEvent>#$TransportationEvent</a>.  <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/transportation-vocab.html#vehicle>#$vehicle</a> is a useful actor slot to have
because this combination occurs quite frequently in rules.  Rather
than repeating these formulas every time we wish to refer to the
vehicle involved in an event, we have created this actor slot.
