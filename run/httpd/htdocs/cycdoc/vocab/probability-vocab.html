        <hr />
        <p /><hr> This file contains some documentation of the initial
        Cyc vocabulary designed to support probabilistic reasoning.  Cyc
        does not perform probabilistic reasoning itself at present; this
        vocabulary is designed to support integration of Cyc with other
        HPKB participants who are working on probabilistic reasoners.
        <p>  This is supposed to support not only Bayesian Network
        reasoning, but also other probabilistic reasoning systems.  No
        assumption is made about how the probabilities will be
        processed.  In particular, <a
        href=/cycdoc/vocab/non-public-ikb-vocab.html#derivedProbability>#$derivedProbability</a>
        and <a
        href=/cycdoc/vocab/non-public-ikb-vocab.html#derivedProbability-Range>#$derivedProbability-Range</a>
        do not commit to the method of derivation.  Some Cyc constants
        should be useful for several approaches, see: <a
        href=/cycdoc/vocab/non-public-ikb-vocab.html#conditionalProbability>#$conditionalProbability</a>,
        <a
        href=/cycdoc/vocab/non-public-ikb-vocab.html#conditionallyIndependent>#$conditionallyIndependent</a>,

        and <a
        href=/cycdoc/vocab/non-public-ikb-vocab.html#lessLikelyThan-Derived>#$lessLikelyThan-Derived</a>.
        <p>  [Note: Cyc's regular #$lessLikelyThan predicate, and its
        causal and risk predicates, are not now tied in to this
        vocabulary in any way.]  <p>  Some constants are tailored for
        Bayesian Network reasoning: <a
        href=/cycdoc/vocab/non-public-ikb-vocab.html#BayesNet>#$BayesNet</a>,
        <a

        and <a

        An explict <a
        href=/cycdoc/vocab/non-public-ikb-vocab.html#BayesNet>#$BayesNet</a>
        needs to be created and associated with a particular <a
        href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory>#$Microtheory</a>
        before Baysian Network reasoning can be done in that <a
        href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory>#$Microtheory</a>.
        The nodes in the <a
        href=/cycdoc/vocab/non-public-ikb-vocab.html#BayesNet>#$BayesNet</a>
        are random variables for Cyc formulae asserted in the
        Microtheory, and the links are <a
        href=/cycdoc/vocab/non-public-ikb-vocab.html#bayesParent>#$bayesParent</a>
        links.  At present the definitions allow multiple <a
        href=/cycdoc/vocab/non-public-ikb-vocab.html#BayesNet>#$BayesNet</a>s
        to be created for one <a
        href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-expansion-vocab.html#Microtheory>#$Microtheory</a>.
        <p> For the time being, at least, probabilities are represented
        by a #$Real0-1 number, where 0 means certainly false and 1 means
        certainly true.<br />

            (a specialization of #$Real0-1) is the probability measure.
            In all contemplated theories of probability, zero means
            certainly false and one means certainly true. The theories
            differ on how to combine different values between these
            extremes. (We may later want to represent probabilities in
            other, or multiple, ways: logarithms, etc.) If you want to
            ensure a precise value for a probability (as most Bayesians
            do), use <a

            probability distribution over the random variables. The <a
            href="./probability-vocab.html#derivedProbability">#$derivedProbability</a>
            of a node can be calculated from the probabilities of its <a
            href="./probability-vocab.html#bayesParent">#$bayesParents.</a>
            (There are always one or more 'source' nodes with no <a
            href="./probability-vocab.html#bayesParent">#$bayesParents.)</a>
            Theoretically, viewed as evidential links based on the joint
            probability distribution, the <a
            href="./probability-vocab.html#bayesParent">#$bayesParent</a>
            links are bidirectional. The direction of the links is
            obtained formally due to an asymmetry between 'parents' and
            'children': the truth of a node induces a conditional
            dependence among its <a
            href="./probability-vocab.html#bayesParent">#$bayesParents</a>
            (the 'explaining away' effect), which does not seem to apply
            to its Bayesian 'child' nodes. Most Bayesian network
            theorists consider that the directions on the links
            correspond to the direction of causal influence, and hence
            to the direction of time. The name 'Bayesian' is due to the
            Reverend Thomas Bayes, whose inversion rule was published
            posthumously in 1763, and later developed by Laplace.
            Bayesian Networks were devised chiefly by Judea Pearl in the 1980s.<br />
