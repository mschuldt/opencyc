            thing involved in that event (here called a `participant',
            although the thing in question might not be playing an
            active role in the event). The first argument of every
            instance of <a
            href="./actor-vocab.html#ActorSlot">#$ActorSlot</a> is
            constrained to be an instance of some specialization of <a

            argument is constrained to be an instance of some
            specialization of <a

            All instances of <a

            #$genlPreds, directly or indirectly, so that the actor slots
            form a kind of hierarchy. Each specialized actor slot
            indicates _how_ its participant participates in the event,
            i.e., in what role (e.g., <a
            href="./actor-vocab.html#inputs">#$inputs,</a> <a
            href="./actor-vocab.html#outputs">#$outputs,</a> <a
            href="./actor-vocab.html#doneBy">#$doneBy).</a> Actor slots
            are _not_ used to indicate the time of an event's
            occurrence, external representations of the event, and other
            more remotely related things that are not directly or
            indirectly `involved' in the occurrence of the event. Time
            and other quantities are relevant to events but are not
            instances of <a
            href="./time-vocab.html#SomethingExisting">#$SomethingExisting;</a>
            thus, they are related to events by some non-#$ActorSlot
            predicate. Things which are remotely related to the event --
            for instance, someone who is affected by the event but
            doesn't exist when the event occurs -- may be related using
            some instance of <a href="./top-vocab.html#Role">#$Role</a>

        <blockquote> This predicate can be used to indicate one of the
            paths followed in some movement event. More formally, <a
            href="./actor-vocab.html#motionPathway-Partial">(#$motionPathway-Partial</a>
            MOVE PATH) means that the instance MOVE of <a
            href="./movement-vocab.html#Movement-TranslationEvent">#$Movement-TranslationEvent</a>
            has a trajectory (see <a
            href="./path-traversal-vocab.html#trajectory-Complete">#$trajectory-Complete)</a>

            of the instance PATH of <a
            href="./path-traversal-vocab.html#Path-Spatial">#$Path-Spatial.</a>
            For example, if a certain trip to Dallas from Austin is via
            highway I-35, this does not imply either that the whole
            journey is along I-35 (it also may be along driveways and
            side streets), or that it is along all of I-35 (which would
            take you from the Mexican border all the way to the Canadian
            border). A part of the journey is along a part of I-35.
            Contrast this predicate with <a
            href="./actor-vocab.html#motionPathway-Complete">#$motionPathway-Complete,</a>
            which indicates the relation between a movement MOVE and an
            instance of <a

            followed throughout all of MOVE.<br />

            href="./actor-vocab.html#ActorSlot">#$ActorSlot</a> (q.v.):
            all other actor slots are specializations of this predicate.
            Thus <a href="./actor-vocab.html#actors">#$actors</a> is a
            broad relation that holds between a given event and any
            contemporary existing thing (see <a
            href="./time-vocab.html#SomethingExisting">#$SomethingExisting)</a>
            that is meaningfully involved in the event. <a
            href="./actor-vocab.html#actors">(#$actors</a> EVENT ACTOR)
            means that ACTOR is somehow saliently (directly or
            indirectly) involved in EVENT during EVENT. An object's
            merely being cotemporal (see <a
            href="./time-vocab.html#cotemporal">#$cotemporal)</a> with
            an event is obviously not sufficient for being an actor in
            it, nor is participating (however centrally) in a
            representation or re-enactment of the event. But note that
            being an actor in the sense is _not_ restricted to things
            that play active (as opposed to passive or instrumental)
            roles in a given event.<br />
