<H2><A NAME="1">1.  Overview of Cyc Inferencing</A></H2>

The Cyc inference engine handles 
<A HREF="glossary.html#modus-ponens">modus ponens</A> 
and 
<A HREF="glossary.html#modus-tollens">modus tollens</A> 
(contrapositive) inferencing, 
<A HREF="glossary.html#universal quantification">universal</A> 
and 
<A HREF="glossary.html#existential quantification">existential</A> 
quantification, and mathematical inferencing.  It uses contexts called 
<A HREF="glossary.html#mt">microtheories</A> 
to optimize inferencing by restricting search domains.<p>

The Cyc 
<A HREF="glossary.html#KB">knowledge base</A> 
contains over 1 million assertions.  Many approaches
commonly taken by other inference engines (such as frames, RETE match,
Prolog, etc.) just don't scale well to KBs of this size.  As a result,
the Cyc team has been forced to develop other techniques.<p>

Cyc also includes several special-purpose inferencing modules for
handling a few specific classes of inference.  One set of modules
handles reasoning concerning collection membership, subsethood, and
disjointness.  Another handles equality reasoning.  Others implement
fast reasoning with <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genlPreds>#$genlPreds</a> and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genlAttributes>#$genlAttributes</a>.  Still others
implement symmetry, transitivity and reflexivity reasoning.


<H2><A NAME="2">2.  The Internal Representation of Assertions</A></H2>

In previous versions of Cyc, formulas are stored and reasoned
with in the same form in which they appear in the KB browser, e.g.

<pre>
   (implies
      (and
         (isa ?afp AdultFemalePerson)
         (residesInRegion ?afp Guam))
      (and
         (acquaintedWith Zippy ?afp)
         (likesAsFriend Zippy ?afp)))
</pre>

In Cyc-10, formulas asserted to the KB are stored internally, and
reasoned with, in 
<A HREF="glossary.html#CNF">conjunctive normal form</A> (CNF).
When converted to CNF, a formula gets rewritten as a conjunction of
disjunctions of negated and non-negated 
<A HREF="glossary.html#literal">literals</A>.
So, for example, the formula above would be written in CNF as:

<pre>
   (and
      (or
         (not (isa ?afp AdultFemalePerson))
         (not (residesInRegion ?afp Guam))
         (acquaintedWith Zippy ?afp))
      (or
         (not (isa ?afp AdultFemalePerson))
         (not (residesInRegion ?afp Guam))
         (likesAsFriend Zippy ?afp)))
</pre>

Each of the conjuncts would become a separate assertion.

<p>
Converting to CNF is part of the job of the Cyc-10 canonicalizer. The canonicalizer
turns CycL formulas into canonical form, so that that they can be
added to the KB as assertions, looked up in the KB, etc.  Some of the
other things the canonicalizer does are outlined below.

<p>
In Cyc-10, as well as in earlier versions of Cyc, 
<A HREF="glossary.html#universal quantification">universal quantification</A> 
is handled trivially by leaving universally quantified variables unbound, while 
<A HREF="glossary.html#existential quantification">existential quantification</A> 
is handled through the use of 
<A HREF="glossary.html#Skolem function">Skolem functions</A>.  
Thus an assertion which is originally entered as:

<pre>
   (forAll ?A
      (implies
         (isa ?A Animal)
         (thereExists ?M
            (and
               (mother ?A ?M)
               (isa ?M FemaleAnimal)))))
</pre>

will be converted to something like:

<pre>
   (implies  
      (isa ?A Animal) 
      (and  
         (mother ?A (SkolemFunctionFn (?A) ?M)) 
         (isa (SkolemFunctionFn (?A) ?M) FemaleAnimal)))
</pre>

and then further converted to CNF:

<pre>
   (and
      (or
         (not (isa ?A Animal))
         (mother ?A (SkolemFunctionFn (?A) ?M)))
      (or
         (not (isa ?A Animal))
         (isa (SkolemFunctionFn (?A) ?M) FemaleAnimal)))
</pre>

Skolem functions are handled exactly like all other functions (except that Cyc
creates and names the function term for you).  You are free to rename
the function term, or do anything else with it that you might do with
a function such as <tt>MotherOf</tt>.  In fact, in Cyc-10 the Skolem
function itself is
<A HREF="glossary.html#reification">reified</A>, 
so that the formula above becomes the following, and would be added to
the KB as 6 separate assertions:

<pre>
   (and
      (or
         (isa SKF-8675309 SkolemFunction))
      (or
         (arity SKF-8675309 1))
      (or
         (arg1Isa SKF-8675309 Animal))
      (or
         (resultIsa SKF-8675309 FemaleAnimal))
      (or
         (not (isa ?U Animal))
         (mother ?U (SKF-8675309 ?U)))
      (or
         (not (isa ?U Animal))
         (isa (SKF-8675309 ?U) FemaleAnimal)))
</pre>

Another task the Cyc-10 canonicalizer takes care of is the ordering of
literals in assertions.  The advantage of a canonical literal order is
that it simplifies KB lookup; only a test for structural equality is
required to determine that 2 formulas are the same.

<p>
The major advantage to using CNF as an internal representation is that
it greatly simplifies the conceptual scheme used in inferencing,
because all axioms have a uniform structure.  For example, using CNF
as a canonical form means that you get 
<A HREF="glossary.html#modus-tollens">modus tollens</A> 
inferencing "for free".  When you add

<pre>
   P and Q => R
</pre>

to the system, it gets canonicalized to the CNF form

<pre>
   not(P) or not(Q) or R
</pre>

Note that both of the following would be canonicalized to the same CNF form:

<pre>
   P and not(R) => not(Q)
   Q and not(R) => not(P)
</pre>

Since the internal CNF can be used to attempt to prove any of three 
<A HREF="glossary.html#literal">literals</A> 
of which it is constituted, it's as if all three forms of the rule
were virtually present in the KB.

<p>
There is only one potential downside to using CNF, which is that
certain types of assertions which can be expressed quite compactly in
conditional form become somewhat unwieldy when converted to CNF.
Specifically, an assertion of the form:

<pre>
   (implies
      (or  P1 P2 P3 ... Pm)
      (and Q1 Q2 Q3 ... Qn))
</pre>

will result in a CNF with m times n conjuncts.  However, we do not
regard this as a significant problem, since asserting formulas of this
form constitutes bad KE style, and thus is unlikely to occur very
often.  In particular, a knowledge enterer who writes such a formula
is probably attempting to use the P1 ... Pm literals as an exhaustive
list of cases in which the consequent should hold, when he or she
should have been shooting for a single meaningful generalization.

<H2><A NAME="3">3.  Inferencing: An Introduction</A></H2>

Backward inferencing--the type of inferencing initiated by an 
<A HREF="glossary.html#ASK">ASK</A> 
operation--can be regarded as a search through a tree of nodes, where
each node represents a
<A HREF="glossary.html#CycL">CycL</A> 
formula for which bindings are sought, and each link represents a
transformation achieved by employing an assertion in the knowledge
base. 

<p>
For example, let's say I ask for bindings for the formula
<tt>(likesObject ?x ?y)</tt>.  That formula will constitute the root
node of an inference search tree.  What I am looking for is any assertion
which will help provide bindings for <tt>?x</tt> and <tt>?y</tt>.  The
KB may contain some ground assertions involving <tt>likesObject</tt>,
such as

<pre>
   (likesObject Keith BillM)
</pre>

and also some if-then rules, such as

<pre>
   (implies
      (possesses ?x ?y)
      (likesObject ?x ?y))
</pre>

Each of these provides a way to expand the root node.  That is, each
constitutes a link to a new node with a different formula to satisfy;
these new nodes will be the leaf nodes of the search.  In the first
case, the formula to satisfy in the new node is simply

<pre>
   <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/math-vocab.html#True>#$True</a>
</pre>

In the second case, using the if-then rule takes us to a new node that
now needs to satisfy the formula

<pre>
   (possesses ?x ?y)
</pre>

The search procedure may now recurse on this new node, because if we
can find bindings for this formula, the if-then rule will give us
bindings for our original formula.  Perhaps the KB also contains a
rule which says,

<pre>
   (implies
      (objectFoundInLocation ?x KeithsHouse)
      (possesses Keith ?x))
</pre>

This assertion can take us to yet another node with the goal formula

<pre>
   (objectFoundInLocation ?x KeithsHouse)
</pre>

That is, we are now looking for things found in Keith's house, because
if something is found in Keith's house, then Keith possesses it, and
if someone possesses something, then he or she likes it.  Note that
this new node has one less free variable than its parent, which is
probably desirable.

<p>
Alternatively, there may be another rule which states

<pre>
   (implies
      (and
         (isa ?x Agent)
         (owns ?x ?y))
      (possesses ?x ?y))
</pre>

This rule could take us to a new node whose formula to satisfy is

<pre>
   (and
      (isa ?x Agent)
      (owns ?x ?y))
</pre>

But this is probably not a happy development: we are now three nodes
down, and the problem is getting more complex, rather than simpler.

<p>
Thus, the primary issue to be addressed in designing an inference
procedure is the algorithm to be used for searching the tree.  How do
we decide which leaf nodes to expand next?  Another important issue is
to determine how a node is expanded.  That is, how do we find the
axioms in the knowledge base which are likely to provide links to new
leaf nodes?

<H2><A NAME="4">4. Inferencing in Cyc</A></H2>

Three important strengths of Cyc inferencing are:

<OL>
<LI>
The inferencing code is modular and stable.
<LI>
The state of the search is maintained, so that a search which
suspends due to resouce constraints can resume where it left off.
<LI>
Search is completely parameterized, so that various kinds of
search may be performed.
</OL>

The first and second items should be self-explanatory, but the third
demands elaboration.  Cyc-10 does heuristic search by default, but
depth-first search is also implemented (and is used for forward
inference, since forward inference requires traversal of the whole
search tree anyway).  Certain applications also take advantage of
parameterized search, doing mostly heuristic search but substituting
in a special method for expanding nodes, or identifying goal nodes,
etc.  Below we discuss the heuristics Cyc-10 search uses and then we
cover the various search parameters.

<H3><A NAME="4.1">4.1  Heuristics for Deciding Which Node to Expand</A></H3>

Cyc-10 uses a number of heuristic rules to decide which leaf node to
expand next.  Some of these are purely syntactic heuristics:

<UL>
<LI>
<B>
Favor nodes with fewer literals to satisfy
</B> 
(as compared with all other unexpanded nodes).  This heuristic helps
to steer the search toward branches that are likely to bottom out
soon.

<LI>
<B>
Favor nodes that have fewer free variables
</B> 
(as compared with all other unexpanded nodes).  Like the preceding
heuristic, this heuristic helps to steer the search toward branches
that are likely to bottom out soon.

<LI>
<B>
Very weakly favor nodes that are higher up in the search tree
</B>.  
This heuristic helps to avoid going too far down into the search
without ever following up on other branches.

<LI>
<B>
Strongly favor nodes with no free variables left at all
</B>.
If there are no free variables left, there's a good chance we'll be
able to determine the truth value of the formula just by doing a KB
lookup.

<LI>
<B>
Weakly disfavor nodes which include negative literals
</B> 
(that is, anything of the form <tt>(not <I>P</I>)</tt>).  Because the
KB consists primarily of positive assertions, it is easier to find
bindings for positive literals than for negative literals.
</UL>

Other heuristics are semantic: 

<UL>
<LI>
<B>
Disfavor nodes which might be part of a unification cycle
</B>.
Basically, try to avoid going in circles.

<LI>
<B>
Disfavor nodes which are less likely to be satisfied by KB lookup
</B>.  
This is done by adding a measure of disfavor to a node for each of its
goal literals that mention a predicate and a constant, but the
constant has no index for the predicate in the KB.
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="4.2">4.2  Weighing Heuristics</A></H3>

These heuristic rules act in concert, according to a linear summation
rule.  One way to think of this is as a chorus of agents, each of
which corresponds to one heuristic and who are each looking to see if
their heuristic applies.  As each candidate node is presented to the
chorus, the agents shriek more or less loudly, according to how
strongly they disfavor the node.  The sum of the volumes of the
shrieks is compared with the sums of other nodes, and the open node
with the lowest sum is expanded next.


<H3><A NAME="4.3">4.3  Heuristics for Deciding Which Literal in a Node to Expand</A></H3>

In many cases, the formula at a node will contain more than one
literal.  In the example developed above, for instance, we saw a node
whose formula to satisfy was

<pre>
   (and
      (isa ?x Agent)
      (owns ?x ?y))
</pre>

If we choose to expand this node, which of these two literals should
we expand first?  Should we look for elements of <tt>Agent</tt>, or
should we look for <tt>owns</tt> pairs? 

<p>
The solution used in Cyc-10 is to require that each 
<A HREF="glossary.html#HL">HL module</A> 
which applies to a literal must be able to provide a heuristic
estimate for how expensive it would be to apply that module to the
literal.  These heuristics are linearly summed, and the literal which
has the lowest heuristic cost is favored most strongly.

<H3><A NAME="4.4">4.4  Parameters of search in Cyc-10</A></H3>

The state of an inference search is provided via a generic search
structure whose slots maintain the methods used to implement the
specific search method.  These slots are filled by functions with the
given arguments and results:

<ul>
<li>
too-deep-func    : node depth-cut -> [boolean]
<br>
The function in this slot is used to test if the search node is beyond
the depth cutoff.

<li>
add-node-func    : node leaves -> leaves
<br>
This slot contains the function used to add a new search node to the
leaves of the search.

<li>
no-leaves-p-func : leaves -> [boolean]
<br>
The function in this slot checks to see if the current search has no
leaves (in which case the search has been exhaustively completed).

<li>
next-node-func   : leaves -> node, leaves
<br>
This slot contains the function which chooses, from among the search
leaves, the next search node to expand.

<li>
goal-p-func      : node -> [boolean]
<br>
This function in this slot is used to determine if the search node
satisfies the search goal.

<li>
add-goal-func    : node goals -> goals
<br>
If the search node is a goal node, the function in this slot adds it
to the list of goals.

<li>
options-func     : node -> [list of options]
<br>
This slot contains the function used to determine which options to use
in expanding the search node.

<li>
expand-func      : node option -> [list of nodes]
<br>
This is the function used to expand a search node into a list of new
'child' search nodes to add to the search.
</ul>

Depth-first and heuristic search are done by the same basic function.
This is possible because when the search is initialized, the slots
above get filled with the correct functions to implement the kind of
search desired.<p>

<H3><A NAME="4.5">4.5  Search Nodes</A></H3>

Under Cyc-10, each search node is a structure with the following slots: 
<UL>
<LI> 
search : the search this node is part of
<LI> 
parent : this node's parent node
<LI> 
children : A list of pointers to this node's children
<LI> 
depth : the depth of this node in the search tree
<LI> 
options : current ways left to expand the node
<LI> 
state : a datastructure that contains the semantics of the node
</UL>

The search node semantic state includes the following information:

<UL>
<LI> 
formula : the CycL formula to satisfy, which represents the
intermediate state of the inference search at this node.
<LI> 
inference supports : the assertions and 
<A HREF="glossary.html#HL">HL modules</A> 
used to transform our parent's formula into our formula.  The
inference supports of this node and all its ancestors together
constitute the complete inference path down to this search node.
<LI> 
variable bindings : a mapping between variables in the parent node and
what they are bound to in this node.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="5">5.  ASKs and Direction</A></H2>

ASKs and ASSERTs use 
<A HREF="glossary.html#direction">direction</A> to control 
which assertions will be accessed during inference.  
Direction comes in two flavors: 
<A HREF="glossary.html#forward">forward</A> 
and
<A HREF="glossary.html#backward">backward</A>.

An ASSERT with direction :forward will cause inference to be performed
at assert time; an ASSERT with direction :backward will cause
inference to be deferred until ask time.

<H3><A NAME="5.1">5.1  Backward GAFs</A></H3>
 
A backward <A HREF="glossary.html#GAF">GAF</A> is a GAF that will
not be involved in forward inference.  Forward inference only takes
place among rules and GAFs that have a :forward direction.  Most
interfaces that assert formulas into the KB adhere to the default that
implication statements (rules) are backward and GAFs are forward.

<H2><A NAME="6">6.  Equality</A></H2>

Equality is handled at unification time.  It's as if the KB had a
unique names assumption: objects with different names are assumed to
be not equal, unless you specifically override the assumption by
asserting that two objects are equal, e.g. <tt>(equals Fred Joe)</tt>.
No inference concerning equality is done at unification time.
