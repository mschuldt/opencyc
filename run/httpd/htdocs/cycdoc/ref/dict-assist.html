This is an introduction to the Dictionary Assistant, which allows
users to add lexical information to Cyc for natural language parsing
and generation.<p>

<h1>The Dictionary Assistant: Walkthrough Examples</h1>

<b></b> <p>The Dictionary Assistant allows a user to hook natural
language terms up with Cyc concepts so that those words can then be
used to refer to those concepts. In this way, Cyc's vast store of
knowledge is accessed via natural language. When a natural language,
say English, word is hooked up with a concept, we say that the concept
has been lexified. You use the Dictionary Assistant to "lexify" Cyc
concepts.  <p>To launch the Dictionary Assistant, look for the link
labelled [Lexify] in the upper left-hand frame of the browser, when
you are viewing a constant.<p>

Cyc will first prompt you to enter the concept about which you want to
add lexical information. As a default, the constant you were browsing
will appear in the typein box.<p> Suppose the term you want to add new
lexical information to is Dog; that is, suppose you want to
refer to the concept Dog in a way currently unfamiliar to
Cyc. For our example we'll add the English word "whelp" to Cyc's
concept Dog so that in the future whenever anyone says "whelp" to Cyc,
it will present Dog as a possible interpretation.  <p>First,
type "dog" into the "Term" box, and type "whelp" into the "Phrase"
box.  <p>On the next screen, Cyc asks whether the phrase "whelp" is a
name. Since "whelp" is a regular noun, not a proper name like "Fred
Jones" or "Dallas" or "the FBI",  you would hit the "No" button.<p>

Next, Cyc will ask you to choose the usage of your new word that
sounds best. In this case, "whelp" sounds fine in both the first and
third contexts. However, since we want to enter a noun that refers to
<i>dog</i>, and not a verb meaning <i>to have puppies</i>, you would
select the first option.<p>

The next screen checks to see whether "whelp" can be pluralized. You
would click "Yes" to this question. Finally, you are asked whether
"whelp" is the most common way of referring to the concept Dog. In
this case, the answer would be No, since terms like "dog" are much
more common.<p>

<p>Now you can go ahead and type in "whelp" whenever you want to refer
to the concept Dog. For example, typing "whelp" into the constant search box in the top of the browser pane and hitting Enter will bring up the constant Dog.<p>

<p>Sometimes you will want to add new lexical information to relations
rather than to individuals or collections, as we just did above, and this process is slightly
different. 

<p>Lexifying predicates or functions is a little trickier than
lexifying concepts such as Dog or individuals such as FredJones,
because whereas the latter can be referred to with words or phrases,
the former need some additional arguments before they can be uniquely
picked out from a group of other relations. For example, the term
"hit" does not help us pick out the relation between an individual
hitting and the thing hit, but "X hits Y" does because here we have
the verb which represents the action and we also have positions for
the two arguments, the hitter and the hittee. So in lexifying
relations, we will need to provide Cyc with examples of sentences
which represent how the various arguments are related to one another.
<p><b>Example</b> <p>Let's use as our example the relation of liking
between two people, where one person likes and the other is liked. For
our example, we will use the Cyc predicate likesAsFriend. Let's assume
that we want to be able to translate things like "Fred <i>fancies</i> Sally"
using the predicate likesAsFriend.<p>


<p>Bring up likesAsFriend in your browser, and click on [Lexify]. In
the "Phrase" box, type "fancy." Now, you will be shown any other
concepts that the word "fancy" already refers to. Click "OK", and on
the next page, you will be asked for an example sentence to illustrate
the use of "fancy" you are entering. A good example sentence here
would be "John fancies Martha"; type this into the box.<p>

On the following pages, you will be asked to map terms in your example
sentence onto argument positions of the predicate
likesAsFriend. First, you would select "John" as argument 1; then,
select "Martha" as argument 2. That is all you need to do. Cyc will
make the appropriate lexical assertions.
