If every CYC&reg; image has a separate copy of the CYC&reg
Knowledge Base (KB), how are the different copies of the KB kept in
sync with each other?

<p>
This is accomplished by having each image write operations
to, and read operations from, one or more transcript files.

<dl>

<dt><a name="ts-file-names"><h3>Transcript File Names</h3></a>

<dd> For each CYC&reg; image (each copy of the CYC&reg KB), there are two transcript files it uses: <dl>
<dt><h4>Master Transcript</h4> 
<dd>The master transcript file is a complete
record of all the operations (changes to the KB) which, when "run" or
evaluated, will result in the next (newest) canonical version of the
KB.  When a CYC&reg; image is started, its copy of the KB is brought into
sync with those of other running images (assuming they all have the
same version of the KB) by loading the operations in the master
transcript file for that KB version.

<dt><h4>Local Transcript</h4>
<dd>The local transcript file is a record of the operations which have been run by a CYC&reg; image.  In the course of a knowledge editing session a new local transcript may be started several times.
</dl>

<dt><a name="com-modes"><h3>Communication Settings</h3></a>
<dd>

There are two parts to the communication status:

<dd>
<h4>What do you want to do with the operations you generate?</h4>
<dl>
<dd><b>Send immediately to the master transcript</b> - local operations are sent to the master transcript as they are processed.  Local operations that are sent to the master transcript are also sent to the local transcript.<p>
<dd><b>Store for later</b> - local operations are sent to the local transcript and then stored for possibly sending to the master transcript later.<p> 
<dd><b>Do not record</b> - local operations are processed and are NOT recorded.  Your image will show the effects of their outcome but you will not have a record of them.
</dl>

<dd>
<h4>Do you want to receive operations from others?</h4>
<dl>
<dd><b>Yes</b> - You want to process the operations that others are sending to the master transcript.<p>
<dd><b>No</b> - You do NOT want to process the operations from the master transcript.
</dl>

<dd><p>Therefore, there are six possible combinations for the communication status:
<dl>
<dd>- Sending and Receiving
<dd>- Sending
<dd>- Storing and Receiving
<dd>- Storing
<dd>- Not Recording but Receiving
<dd>- Not Recording or Receiving
</dl>

<dd><p>
The Communication Status page is where you can view and change your communication settings.  When Storing operations, a new section of the communication status page will appear.  In this section you are given the option of sending your stored operations or clearing them from storage.  Selecting either option will cause a new local transcript to be started for the image.  Selecting clear does NOT mean the stored operations will be erased(they will still be in the local transcript).





<dt><a name="queues-and-fi"><h3>Queues and the Functional Interface</h3></a>
<dd>

State-controlling variables that experienced users of CYC&reg;
should know about are *use-local-queue?* and *run-own-operations?*.  <p>

The value of *use-local-queue?* determines whether or not operations
performed in the local image will be executed immediately (thus
blocking the execution of other processes), or pushed onto the local
queue to be executed at a time determined by the CYC&reg; Agenda.  The
possible values for this variable are T and NIL.  In most cases (most
of the time), *use-local-queue?* will be set to T.  This means that
every KB-modifying operation performed using any of the top-level
Functional Interface (FI) functions (e.g., FI-ASSERT) will
automatically be pushed onto *local-queue* to be executed by the CYC&reg;
Agenda.  Usually this is a good thing, because otherwise the operation
would be executed immediately where you typed it in (or where it was
evaluated internally through the web browser interface).  If it
happened to be a long operation, you would be forced to wait before
you (or another application) could continue to interact with CYC&reg;.
However, you may sometimes want the evaluation of a Functional Interface
function to happen immediately.  In this case, set the value of
*use-local-queue?* to NIL by evaluating<p>

<pre>
  (CSETQ *use-local-queue?* NIL)
</pre><p>

in the Interactor web interface page.  If you are typing SubL
expressions directly to a read-eval-print loop (extremely rare for
doing knowledge entry), use the procedure SAFE-FI.<p>

<pre>
  (SAFE-FI <keyword> <arguments>)
</pre><p>

For example, instead of typing the form<p>

<pre>
  (FI-ASSERT '(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> #$Siegel <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Person>#$Person</a>) <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#BaseKB>#$BaseKB</a>)
</pre><p>

you would type<p>

<pre>
  (SAFE-FI :assert '(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> #$Siegel <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Person>#$Person</a>) <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#BaseKB>#$BaseKB</a>) 
</pre><p>

The value of *run-own-operations?* determines whether or not your
local CYC&reg; image will process operations originating from it when
reading operations from a transcript file.  In most cases this
should be set to NIL.  However, if an image dies and needs to be
restarted (due, e.g., to a power failure or irrecoverable memory
error), you will usually want it to evaluate its own operations
when it is restarted and loads the master transcript file, so
that it will be in sync with the other running images.  This is
just something to be aware of and watch for -- the right thing
should happen automatically, and you should never have to
manually set the value of this variable.  <p>

<dt><a name="ts-contents"><h3>What is in a transcript file?</h3></a>
<dd>

Each expression in a transcript file is a list
of four elements, with the following form:
<p>
<b>([user] [image-id] [date] [encapsulated op]) </b>
<dl>
<dt><dd>  <b>[user]</b> = the originating user's name
<dt><dd>  <b>[image-id]</b> = the ID of the originating CYC&reg; image
<dt><dd>  <b>[date]</b> = date the operation was added to the transcript file
<dt><dd>  <b>[encapsulated op]</b> = an encapsulated FI operation
</dl>
<p>
An encapsulated operation is one in which all CYC&reg; constants
(e.g., <b><a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a></b>) are referred to as lists including name-id
pairs (e.g., <b>(:HP "isa" 260))</b> rather than as Cyc-constant
data objects.


<dt><a name="loading-ts"><h3>Loading an Arbitrary Transcript File</h3></a>
<dd>

Arbitrary transcript files can be loaded in two ways.  The easiest way
is to click on the [Load Transcript File] link in the CYC&reg; Navigator,
and follow the instructions presented there.<p>

In a read-eval-print loop, you can also call the function
LOAD-TRANSCRIPT-FILE with the appropriate arguments.  These
arguments include the pathname of the file to be loaded, a
boolean value (T or NIL) indicating whether or not operations
that originated in the local image should be loaded, and a
keyword indicating onto which queue the loaded operations should be
pushed.  The possibilities for the last argument (the queue
keyword) are :local, :remote, and :none.  :None means that the
Functional Interface commands in the transcript will be evaluated
immediately, and other processes will be forced to wait until
they are finished.


<dt><a name="fi-direct"><h3>Calling FI Functions Directly</h3></a>
<dd>

Direct calls to FI functions act just like editing commands from
the CYC&reg; Web Interface: by default, they are queued for execution
by the agenda and saved in transcript files.  It is important to
be aware of this behavior to avoid sharing unintended operations
with other CYC&reg; Servers at a site.<p>

When a CYC&reg; image is started and the CYC&reg init file is loaded, the
global variables *use-local-queue?* and *use-transcript?* are
initialized to T. With these settings, every FI command you
evaluate (even including fi-ask), will be added to your
transcript queue and (if your agenda is running) saved to a
transcript file. If you are <b>Sending</b> operations or <b>Storing</b> and
you send your stored operations, the operations will be appended to the master transcript file, and everyone who is reading from the master file will run your operations.<p>

Changing your communication status is one way to safely alter the
setting of these variables.  For example, if you go into a <b>Not Recording</b> mode
then no operations performed in your CYC&reg; image will be added to its
transcript queue.  In rare cases, a user might want to "manually" set
*use-transcript?* to NIL.  If you think you need to manually set these
variables, check with your contact at Cycorp.

Here is a way to handle a common situation -- you want to run some
cleanup operations that will be included in the next KB dump, but you
don't want everyone to be forced to run the cleanup: <p>

Cycorp has adopted the informal policy of using one CYC&reg; image as a
dedicated KB cleanup and dump image.  If you want to run large
numbers of cleanup operations to be included in the next dump, you can
run them in the dedicated image with the communication status set
to <b>Storing</b> and then clear the operations from storage. The local transcript file containing the operations can then be loaded on the dump image (make sure not to send them to the master transcript) immediately before the next dump.  <p>


If in the context of some cleanup you write code or evaluate FI
commands "manually" (in a SubL read-eval-print loop), use the
generalized "safe" dispatcher function for FI commands called
SAFE-FI.  Within calls to SAFE-FI, *use-local-queue?* and
*use-transcript?* are bound to NIL, so there is no danger of
unintended operations ending up in a transcript file.  For
example, instead of calling: <p>

<pre>
  (FI-ASK '(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arity>#$arity</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/organization-vocab.html#customers>#$customers</a> ?Y) <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#BaseKB>#$BaseKB</a>)
</pre><p>

you could call:<p>

<pre>
  (SAFE-FI :ask '(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arity>#$arity</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/organization-vocab.html#customers>#$customers</a> ?Y) <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#BaseKB>#$BaseKB</a>)
</pre>
<p>

Note that the first expression above would not return an answer
unless *use-local-queue?* were set to NIL. Instead, the result of
the evaluation would be pushed onto the local queue, and the evaluated
form would return the keyword :queued.  However, the second
expression is guaranteed to return a result, since *use-local-queue?*
is internally bound to NIL.


<dt><a name="more-comments"><h3>Additional Comments</h3></a>
<dd>

Just about everything described above -- transcript file management,
setting the values of variables, etc. -- should happen automatically.
You should never have to name a local or master transcript file,
specify a version number, append files, or directly set a variable's
value. If for some reason you believe that you need to do one of these
things (or something more arcane), please contact Keith Goolsbey, Nick
Siegel, or another member of the Cycorp Technical Board.

<dt><a name="dump"><h3>What "dump" Means</h3></a>
<dd>

Readers of this documentation will occasionally encounter the
term "dump" and the phrases "do a dump" or "dump the KB".
"Dumping the KB" means that one CYC&reg; image will be used to save
the current state of its KB out to a set of specially formatted
files (.cfasl files).  These files will then be used to construct
a new version of the KB.  In effect, this is like taking a
snapshot of the current state of the KB in the dump image and
using that snapshot as the starting place for the next image to
be built.  When a dump has started, the dump image will read
<b>no further operations from the master transcript file</b>,
and any operations written to that file after the dump
has started will not be included in the new image to be built.

<p>

Note that users of other copies of the current CYC&reg; image (copies
other than the particular image being used to do the dump) can
always continue to work (do new knowledge entry) after a dump has
started.  Just switch to a non-sending communication status.  This
will start a local transcript file for your new operations.
After a new image is built and you have started it, you can then
load your transcript file, specifying that the operations should
go on the local queue.  The operations will then be treated as if
they had just now been performed in the new image, and they will
be included in the new master transcript file.

<a name="cyc-agenda"><h2>The CYC&reg; Agenda</h2></a>
What controls how often, or how frequently, operations are
written from the transcript queue to a transcript file?  What do all those numbers on the "Server Status" ("System Area") page REALLY mean?<p>

The CYC&reg; Agenda is the process running in a CYC&reg image which performs all
the tasks needed to manage CYC&reg; operations:  moving operations from one
queue to another, executing operations, reading from transcript files,
writing to transcript files, and loading CYC&reg; source code patches.<p>

In computer science terms, the CYC&reg; Agenda is a finite state
machine which continually moves from state to state, testing for
a certain set of conditions in each state, and causing specific
actions to be performed when the conditions hold.<p>

Or you can think of the agenda as a manager who spends all day checking
her watch and running back and forth between the offices of her
employees, telling each one when it is time to do something.<p>

<a name="agenda-flow"><h3>A Flowchart for the CYC&reg; Agenda</h3></a>

A CYC&reg; image id consists of three elements: a machine name,
a process ID integer, and a large integer indicating the universal time
at which the image was started.  (Thus, every image started from
a CYC&reg; executable will have a different, unique ID, even if two or
more images are started on the same machine).

<dt><h4>System and patch level: [patch level]</h4>
<dd>

Indicates the version number (system number and patch level) of the
CYC&reg; image.

<dt><h4>Master Transcript Operations Read But Unprocessed: [n]</h4>
<dd>

The integer [n] indicates the number of operations that have
been read from the master transcript but have not yet been processed.

<dt><h4>Master Transcript Operations Read: [n]</h4>
<dd>

The integer [n] indicates the number of operations that have been read and processed from the master transcript. 

<dt><h4>Unprocessed Local Queue Operations: [n]</h4>
<dd>

The integer [n] indicates the current number of operations sitting in
the local queue waiting to be processed.

<dt><h4>Local Queue Operations Processed But Unrecorded: [n]</h4>
<dd>

The integer [n] indicates the current number of operations that have
been processed from the local queue and pushed into the transcript queue,
but have not yet been saved to the local transcript.

<dt><h4>Current Local Transcript Operations Processed And Recorded: [n]</h4>
<dd>

The integer [n] indicates the number of local operations that have
been processed and saved to the current local transcript.

<dt><h4>Master Transcript: [transcript file name]</h4>
<dd>

The name of the master transcript is provided.  This file can be examined
by clicking on the file name.

<dt><h4>Characters: [n]</h4>
<dd>

The integer [n] specifies the number of characters in the master transcript.

<dt><h4>Estimated Ops: [n] </h4>
<dd>

The integer [n] specifies the approximate number of operations in the master transcript.

<dt><h4>Operations Read: [n] </h4>
<dd>

The integer [n] specifies the  number of operations read from the master transcript.  This number will be equal to the sum of Master Transcript Operations Read But Unprocessed and Master Transcript Operations Read fro the Queue Information section.

<dt><h4>Local Transcript: [transcript file name]</h4>
<dd>

The name of the local transcript is provided.  This is the file that all operations generated by this image are being recorded in.  This file can be examined by clicking on the file name.
