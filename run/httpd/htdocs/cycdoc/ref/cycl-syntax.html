CycL is a formal language whose syntax derives from 
<A HREF="glossary.html#FOPC">first-order predicate calculus</A> 
(the language of formal logic) and from Lisp. In order to express
common sense knowledge, however, it goes far beyond first order logic. 
The vocabulary of CycL consists of <A HREF="glossary.html#term">terms</A>.  
The set of terms can be divided into 
<A HREF="glossary.html#constant">constants</A>, 
<A HREF="glossary.html#NAT">non-atomic terms</A> (NATs), 
<A HREF="glossary.html#variable">variables</A>, and a few other types 
of objects.  Terms are combined into meaningful CycL 
<A HREF="glossary.html#expression">expressions</A>, 
which are used to make <A HREF="glossary.html#assertion">assertions</A> 
in the CYC&reg; <A HREF="glossary.html#KB">knowledge base</A>.

<H2><A NAME="constants">Constants</A></H2> 
<dl> 

Constants are the "vocabulary words" of the CYC&reg; knowledge base.  The CYC&reg
KB is an attempt to model the world as most sane, adult humans perceive
it, so each constant stands for some thing or concept in the world that
we think many people know about and/or that most could understand.<p>

The KB contains constants that denote collections of other concepts,
such as <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/physiology-vocab.html#AnimalWalkingProcess>#$AnimalWalkingProcess</a> (the set of all actions in which some animal
walks) or #$Typewriter (the set of all typewriters).  It can
have constants that denote individual things, some of which are
more-or-less permanently in the KB, like
#$InternalRevenueService, and some of which might get created
only when reasoning about some state of affairs, like
#$Walking00036 (a particular case of walking).  Some of the
individuals represented in the KB are predicates, such as
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> or <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#likesAsFriend>#$likesAsFriend</a>, that allow one to express
relationships among constants.  Others are functions, such as
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#GovernmentFn>#$GovernmentFn</a>, which can take constants or other things as
arguments, and generate new concepts (i.e., (#$GovernmentOf
#$Canada)).<p>

Each constant has its own data structure in the KB, consisting of the constant and the assertions which describe it.  
   
<dt><H3><A NAME="constant names">Constant Names</A></H3>
<dd>

Most CYC&reg; constants have a unique name, such as #$BillJ,
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#massOfObject>#$massOfObject</a>, or #$MapleTree.  (For information on
those that don't, see <A HREF="#reifiable-functions">Reifiable
Functions</A> below.)<p>

CYC&reg; constants are referred to with the prefix "#$&quot; (read
"hash-dollar").  These characters are sometimes omitted in documents
describing CycL, and they may be omitted by certain interface tools.
But in these CYC&reg; Documentation pages, the policy will be to use the "#$&quot;
prefix when referring to CYC&reg; constants.<p>

<dt><H3><A NAME="naming conventions">Naming Conventions</A></H3>
<dd>

The name of a CYC&reg;
 constant -- the part after the "#$&quot; prefix -- must
follow these rules:

All CYC&reg; constant names must be at least 2 characters long
(not including the #$ prefix).<p>

Constant names can include any uppercase or lowercase letter, any digit,
and the symbols "-" (dash), "_" (underscore), and "?" (question mark).
No other characters, such as "!", "&amp", or "@" are allowed.
This policy is enforced in the CYC&reg; Functional Interface and in the CYC&reg
Web Interface.<p>

CYC&reg; constant names are case-sensitive: #$foo is not the same as #$Foo.
However, distinguishing two constant names solely on the basis of
capitalization is prohibited by the system.<p>

All CYC&reg; predicate names must begin with a lowercase
character.  (This does not include all the things that are presently
instances of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Predicate>#$Predicate</a> in CYC&reg;.  Some of these
latter things are more like functions, and their names begin
with uppercase letters).<p>

All non-predicate constant names must begin with an
uppercase character.  Non-predicate constant names may also
begin with a numeric character (e.g., #$3MCorporation).  We
may also allow predicates to begin with numeric characters,
if someone makes a compelling argument for why this should
be allowed.<p>

All CYC&reg; constant names should be composed of one or more
meaningful "words" in sequence, with no breaks except for
dashes or underlines (e.g. <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> and
#$SportsCar).  A sequence of numeric characters may
count as a "word" (e.g., #$FrontOfficeOf123Corp).  With the
exception noted above for predicate names, each
(non-numeric) "word" in a sequence must begin with a capital
letter.  An acronym may count as a "word", but all its
characters will be the same case (e.g., lower case if the
acronym begins the name of a predicate constant;
otherwise uppercase).<p>

Hyphens are used to set off parts of names which restrict or refine the
meaning of the name, as in #$Fruit-TheWord or #$Horse-Domesticated.<p>

<dt><H3><A NAME="naming strategies">Naming Strategies</A></H3>
<dd>

In general, it's best to give related constants names which are
alphabetically proximal.  Some of our interface tools make it easy to
search for all constants whose name begins with a certain string of
characters, and it's easier to find all constants having to do with
horses if they have been given names like #$Horse-Domesticated and
#$Horse-Wild than if they have been given names like "DomesticatedHorse"
and "WildHorse".<p>

When naming a constant, it's important to assign a name that
distinguishes the denoted concept from other concepts it might get
confused with.  So "Bow" would be a terrible name for a constant.
Instead, names like "Bow-BoatPart", "BowTheWeapon",
"Bowing-BodyMovement" should be used, depending on the underlying
concept denoted.<p>

Sometimes it is possible to take this principle of specificity in names
to an extreme, and attempt to embody the whole meaning of the constant
in its name.  This is discouraged.  For example, one might be tempted to
give the constant <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/part-vocab.html#physicalParts>#$physicalParts</a> the name
"distinctIdentifiablePhysicalParts", but it is better to leave the name
a bit terser since it isn't easily confused with some other concept, and
put the additional information in the <A
HREF="glossary.html#constant-docs">constant documentation</A>.
    
<dt><H3><A NAME="significance of names">Significance of Names</A></H3>
<dd>

It's important to remember that the names we assign to constants mean
nothing to CYC&reg;.  It doesn't matter whether the concept <I>green </I> is
represented by #$Green, #$GreenColor, #$Verde, #$Gruen, or #$EMRG.<p>

It's also very important never to assume that you, the observer of the
CYC&reg; KB, can know with certainty what a constant denotes to the system,
just from seeing its name and nothing else.<p>

The meaning of a constant in CycL is determined by the assertions in the
KB that use that constant.  For example, from the following assertions,
it is easy to tell what the hypothetical constant #$EMRG means:

<pre>
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> #$EMRG <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#Color>#$Color</a>)
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#colorOfObject>#$colorOfObject</a> #$Grass37 #$EMRG)
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#forAll>#$forAll</a> ?O (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a> (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> ?O #$Okra) (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#colorOfObject>#$colorOfObject</a> ?O #$EMRG)))
</pre>

For convenience, we choose names for CYC&reg; constants that will indicate to
human users what the constant is intended to mean.  (For example, #$Red
or #$RedColor.)  But remember, CYC&reg; doesn't understand those strings.
Don't be misled by evocative names like
#$LittleRedHairedGirlLikedByCharlieBrown.  Unless that constant is
appropriately related to other CYC&reg; constants such as #$FemaleChild,
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/physiology-vocab.html#hairColor>#$hairColor</a>, #$RedHairColor, #$CharlieBrown, and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#likesAsFriend>#$likesAsFriend</a>, it is
meaningless to CYC&reg;.<p>

</dl>

<H2><A NAME="variables">Variables</A></H2>

<A HREF="glossary.html#quantification">Quantified</A> CycL expressions
(discussed below) contain one or more variables which stand for <A
HREF="glossary.html#constant">constants</A> whose identities are not
specified.  A variable may appear (nearly) anywhere a constant can
appear.

<dl>

<dt><H3><A NAME="variable names">Variable Names</A></H3>  
<dd>

Variable names must begin with a question mark and are
ordinarily written in capital letters ("?FOO").  Variable names are
subject to the same restrictions on usable characters as <a

<dt><H3><A NAME="variable naming conventions">Naming

<dd>

In formulas in which only one variable is used, it is common to use a
single-letter variable, such as "?X".  However, when a formula
contains more than one variable, it will be much more readable if you
give the variables mnemonic names.  Here's an example:

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>
      (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#and>#$and</a>
         (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> ?TRANSFER <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#TransferringPossession>#$TransferringPossession</a>)
         (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#fromPossessor>#$fromPossessor</a> ?TRANSFER ?FROM))
      (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> ?FROM <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#SocialBeing>#$SocialBeing</a>))
</pre>

"The initial possessor in a possession transfer is a social being."

CycL <A HREF="glossary.html#CycLForm">formulas</A> combine <A
HREF="glossary.html#term">terms</A> into meaningful expressions.<p>

Every formula has the structure of a Lisp list.  It is enclosed in
parentheses, and consists of a list of objects which are commonly
designated ARG0, ARG1, ARG2, etc.  The object in the ARG0 position may
be a <A HREF="glossary.html#predicate">predicate</A>, a <A
HREF="glossary.html#logical connective">logical connective</A>, or a <A
HREF="glossary.html#quantifier">quantifier</A>.  The remaining arguments
may be <A HREF="glossary.html#constant-atomic">atomic constants</A>, <A
HREF="glossary.html#NAT">non-atomic terms</A>, <A
HREF="glossary.html#variable">variables</A>, numbers, English strings
delimited by double quotes ("), or other formulas.

<dl>

<dt><H3><A NAME="CycFormula">#$CycFormula</A></H3>
<dd>
This is the class of <A HREF="glossary.html#well-formed">well-formed</A>
formulas in CycL.  If a CycL formula satisfies all the constraints on the
number and types of arguments to the <A
HREF="glossary.html#relation">relations</A> that appear in it, 
the system will recognize it as an instance of the
collection <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#CycFormula>#$CycFormula</a>.

<dt><H3><A NAME="atomic formulas">Atomic Formulas</A></H3>
<dd>

The simplest kind of formula is an atomic formula: a formula in which
the ARG0 position is occupied by a predicate, and all the other argument
positions are filled with terms:

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#likesAsFriend>#$likesAsFriend</a> #$DougLenat #$KeithGoolsbey)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/role-vocab.html#skillCapableOf>#$skillCapableOf</a> #$LinusVanPelt #$PlayingAMusicalInstrument <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/actor-vocab-complete.html#performedBy>#$performedBy</a>)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#colorOfObject>#$colorOfObject</a> ?CAR ?COLOR)
</pre>

The first two of the atomic formulas above are <A
HREF="glossary.html#GAF">ground atomic formulas</A> (GAFs), since none
of the terms filling the argument positions ARG1, ARG2, etc. are
variables.
</dl>

<H2><A NAME="predicates">Predicates</A></H2>

Every CycL atomic formula must begin with a predicate in order to be <A
HREF="glossary.html#well-formed">well-formed</A>.

<dl>

<dt><h3><A NAME="predicate arity">Predicate Arity</A></H3>
<dd>

Most predicates are defined to take a fixed number of arguments.
There are no optional predicate arguments in CycL.  However, a few
predicates, such as <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#different>#$different</a>, can take a variable number of
arguments.  Such predicates are elements of the collection
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/math-vocab.html#VariableArityRelation>#$VariableArityRelation</a>. In most cases, arity is automatically inferred by CYC&reg;
when a relation or predicate is made an instance of a certain type of
collection (e.g. <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#BinaryPredicate>#$BinaryPredicate</a>).  However, arity can also be
asserted directly, via the binary predicate <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arity>#$arity</a>.<p>

The number of arguments a predicate takes is determined by its <A
HREF="glossary.html#arity">arity</A>.  A predicate is described as
unary, binary, ternary, quaternary, or quintary, according to whether it
takes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 arguments.  Currently, no CycL predicate takes
more than 5 arguments; however, if some representation required a
predicate to take more arguments, CycL would be changed to allow
this.<p>

To be well-formed, an atomic formula must have the right number of
arguments for the predicate filling the ARG0 position.  So,

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#likesAsFriend>#$likesAsFriend</a> #$DougLenat #$KeithGoolsbey #$Fido)
</pre>

is not well-formed, since the arity of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#likesAsFriend>#$likesAsFriend</a> is 2, but this formula gives 3 arguments to <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#likesAsFriend>#$likesAsFriend</a>.

<dt><h3><A NAME="predicate argument types">Predicate Argument Types</A></H3>
<dd>

The type of each argument must be specified in the definition of the
predicate, using the predicates <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arg1Isa>#$arg1Isa</a>, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arg2Isa>#$arg2Isa</a>,
etc.  For example, suppose the predicate <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#residesInDwelling>#$residesInDwelling</a> is defined
by the following:

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#residesInDwelling>#$residesInDwelling</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#BinaryPredicate>#$BinaryPredicate</a>)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arg1Isa>#$arg1Isa</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#residesInDwelling>#$residesInDwelling</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Animal>#$Animal</a>)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arg2Isa>#$arg2Isa</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#residesInDwelling>#$residesInDwelling</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/construction-vocab.html#ShelterConstruction>#$ShelterConstruction</a>)
</pre>

To be well-formed, every formula which has <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#residesInDwelling>#$residesInDwelling</a> in the
ARGO position must have a term which is an instance of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Animal>#$Animal</a> in the
ARG1 position, and term which is an instance of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/construction-vocab.html#ShelterConstruction>#$ShelterConstruction</a> in
the ARG2 position.  So,

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#residesInDwelling>#$residesInDwelling</a> #$PottedPlant37 #$KarensHouse)
</pre>

is probably not well-formed.  Though we can never be absolutely certain
just from the names, #$KarensHouse could be an instance of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/construction-vocab.html#ShelterConstruction>#$ShelterConstruction</a>, but #$PottedPlant37 is probably not an instance
of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Animal>#$Animal</a>.

</dl>

<H2><A NAME="logical connectives">Logical Connectives</A></H2>

Complex formulas can be built up out of 
<A HREF="glossary.html#atomic formula">atomic formulas</A> 
or other complex formulas by using <A
HREF="glossary.html#logical connective">logical connectives</A>, which
are special constants analogous to the logical operators of formal
logic.  The most important logical connectives in CycL are <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#not>#$not</a>,
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#and>#$and</a>, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#or>#$or</a>, and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>.

<dl>

<dt><H3><A NAME="not">#$not</A></H3>
<dd>

The connective <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#not>#$not</a> takes a single <A
HREF="glossary.html#formula">formula</A> as an argument.  Like the "not"
of formal logic, it reverses the <A HREF="glossary.html#tv">truth
value</A> of its argument.  Thus,

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#not>#$not</a> (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#colorOfObject>#$colorOfObject</a> #$FredsBike #$RedColor))
</pre>

will be true if and only if (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#colorOfObject>#$colorOfObject</a> #$FredsBike #$RedColor) is
false.  Likewise,

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#not>#$not</a> (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#not>#$not</a> (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#colorOfObject>#$colorOfObject</a> #$FredsBike #$RedColor))) 
</pre>

will have the same truth value as (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#colorOfObject>#$colorOfObject</a> #$FredsBike #$RedColor).<p>

<dt><H3><A NAME="and">#$and</A></H3>
<dd>

The connective <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#and>#$and</a> takes one or more formulas as arguments.  Like
the "and" of formal logic, it returns true if and only if each of its
arguments evaluates to true.  Here's an example:

<pre>
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#and>#$and</a>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#colorOfObject>#$colorOfObject</a> #$FredsBike #$RedColor)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/spatial-vocab.html#objectFoundInLocation>#$objectFoundInLocation</a> #$FredsBike #$FredsGarage))
</pre>

This formula states that Fred's bike is red and that it is located in
Fred's garage.  If both of those things are true then the whole formula
is true, but if one or both are false, then the whole formula is false.

<dt><H3><A NAME="or">#$or</A></H3>
<dd>

The connective <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#or>#$or</a> takes one or more formulas as arguments.  Like
the "or" of formal logic, it returns true if and only if at least one of
its arguments evaluates to true.  Here's an example:

<pre>
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#or>#$or</a>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#colorOfObject>#$colorOfObject</a> #$FredsBike #$RedColor)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/spatial-vocab.html#objectFoundInLocation>#$objectFoundInLocation</a> #$FredsBike #$FredsGarage)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#owns>#$owns</a> #$Fred #$FredsBike))
</pre>

This assertion states that either Fred's bike is red, or it is located
in Fred's garage, or Fred owns it, <I>or all three</I>.  (The word "or"
in English is sometimes taken to imply that one alternative or the other
is true, but not both.  That is not the case with <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#or>#$or</a>.)  If any or
all of these three statements is true, then the whole formula is true.
All would have to be false for the formula as a whole to be false.

<dt><H3><A NAME="implies">#$implies</A></H3>	
<dd>

The connective <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a> takes exactly two formulas as arguments.
Like the "if-then" statement of formal logic, it returns true if and
only if it is not the case that its first argument is true and its
second argument is false.  Here's an example:

<pre>
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#owns>#$owns</a> #$Fred #$Bike001)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#colorOfObject>#$colorOfObject</a> #$Bike001 #$RedColor))
</pre>

This assertion states that if #$Bike001 is owned by #$Fred, then it is red.
Newcomers to formal logic may misinterpret <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a> as implying
a causal relationship.  But, strictly speaking, a <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>
assertion says only that either the first argument is false, or the
second argument is true.  So, for example, the assertion

Assertions involving <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a> are very common in the CYC&reg; KB.  We
also call them <A HREF="glossary.html#conditional">conditionals</A> or
<A HREF="glossary.html#rule">rules</A>, and we often refer to the first
argument as the <A HREF="glossary.html#antecedent">antecedent</A> and
the second argument as the <A
HREF="glossary.html#consequent">consequent</A>.  Note, however, that the
particular formula above is <i>not</i> representative of assertions
likely to be found in the CYC&reg; KB.  We will come to some more
representative examples in a moment.

<dt><H3><A NAME="well-formedness">Well-Formedness of Complex Formulas</A></H3>
<dd>

Any complex formula formed by using the logical connectives will be <A
HREF="glossary.html#well-formed">well-formed</A> if the formulas given
as arguments to the connectives are also well-formed and if the right
number of arguments are given.  (The formulas given as arguments to
the logical connectives need not be atomic formulas, like most of the
examples above, but can be any well-formed formula.)  Another way of
saying this is that <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#not>#$not</a>, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#and>#$and</a>, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#or>#$or</a> and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a> produce
<A HREF="glossary.html#CycLForm">CycFormulas</A> when they are given
arguments which are also
<A HREF="glossary.html#CycLForm">CycFormulas</A>.<p> Suppose A and B
are syntactically legal, and C is not.  Then,

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#not>#$not</a> A)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#and>#$and</a> A)

   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a> A B)
</pre>

would all be CycFormulas.  But

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#not>#$not</a> A B)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#and>#$and</a>)

   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a> A)
</pre>

would NOT be CycFormulas.  Why?  (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#not>#$not</a> A B) violates the requirement
that <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#not>#$not</a> take only one formula as an argument.
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#and>#$and</a>) and (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a> A) also violate
restrictions on the number of formulas these connectives take as
arguments.  (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#and>#$and</a> A C) is not well-formed because C
is not; any complex formula that contained C would be
syntactically bad for the same reason.<p>
  
It should also be noted that <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#and>#$and</a> and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#or>#$or</a> are elements of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/math-vocab.html#VariableArityRelation>#$VariableArityRelation</a>: hence, if A, B, C, and D are well-formed CycL
expressions,

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#and>#$and</a> A B C D)
</pre> 

would be well-formed and also

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#or>#$or</a> A B C D)
</pre>

would be well-formed.

<H2><A NAME="quantification">Quantification</A></H2>	

So far, we have only looked at ways to make statements about specific
objects, like #$FredsBike.  But CycL, like <A
HREF="glossary.html#FOPC">first-order predicate calculus</A>, also gives
us two ways to talk about objects without being specific about the
identity of the objects involved: <A HREF="glossary.html#universal-quantification">universal quantification</A> and <A
HREF="glossary.html#existential quantification">existential
quantification</A>.  Universal quantification corresponds to English
expressions like <i>every</i>, <i>all</i>, <i>always</i>,
<i>everyone</i>, and <i>anything</i>, while existential quantification
corresponds to English expressions like <i>someone</i>,
<i>something</i>, and <i>somewhere</i>.  CycL contains one universal <A
HREF="glossary.html#quantifier">quantifier</A>, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#forAll>#$forAll</a>, and four
existential <A HREF="glossary.html#quantifier">quantifiers</A>,
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#thereExists>#$thereExists</a>, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#thereExistAtLeast>#$thereExistAtLeast</a>, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#thereExistAtMost>#$thereExistAtMost</a>, and
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#thereExistExactly>#$thereExistExactly</a>.

<dl> 

<dt><H3><A NAME="forAll">forAll</A></H3>
<dd>

The quantifier <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#forAll>#$forAll</a> takes two arguments, a <A
HREF="glossary.html#variable">variable</A> and a <A
HREF="glossary.html#formula">formula</A> in which the variable appears.
In practice, the formula is almost always a <A
HREF="glossary.html#conditional">conditional</A> in which the <A
HREF="glossary.html#antecedent">antecedent</A> is used to restrict the
scope of the variable.  Here's an example:

<pre>
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#forAll>#$forAll</a> ?X
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>
      (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#owns>#$owns</a> #$Fred ?X)
      (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/spatial-vocab.html#objectFoundInLocation>#$objectFoundInLocation</a> ?X #$FredsHouse)))
</pre>

This formula states that it is true, concerning every object in the CYC&reg;
<A HREF="glossary.html#ontology">ontology</A>, that if #$Fred owns that
object, then that object is located in #$FredsHouse.  In other words,
all Fred's stuff is in his house.

<dt><H3><A NAME="multiple quantification">Multiple Quantification</A></H3>
<dd>

Formulas may contain more than one quantifier, as in the following:

<pre>
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#forAll>#$forAll</a> ?X
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#forAll>#$forAll</a> ?Y
      (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>
         (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#and>#$and</a>
            (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#owns>#$owns</a> #$Fred ?X)
            (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#owns>#$owns</a> #$Fred ?Y))
         (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/spatial-vocab.html#near>#$near</a> ?X ?Y))))
</pre>

which says that any two things owned by Fred are near each other.  Note
that each quantifier introduces a new variable, and that each variable
must have a different name.
  
<dt><H3><A NAME="unbound variables">Unbound Variables</A></H3>
<dd>

Normally, variables need to be introduced ("bound") by a quantifier
before they are used.  Each quantifier binds exactly one variable, and
every variable used should be bound by exactly one quantifier.
Furthermore, a variable has no meaning outside the <A
HREF="glossary.html#scope">scope</A> of the quantifier which binds
it.<p>

However, if a unbound variable appears in a CycL formula, it is always
assumed to be universally quantified, with the result that

<pre>
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#owns>#$owns</a> #$Fred ?X)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/spatial-vocab.html#objectFoundInLocation>#$objectFoundInLocation</a> ?X #$FredsHouse))
</pre>

is exactly equivalent to

<pre>
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#forAll>#$forAll</a> ?X
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>
      (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#owns>#$owns</a> #$Fred ?X)
      (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/spatial-vocab.html#objectFoundInLocation>#$objectFoundInLocation</a> ?X #$FredsHouse)))
</pre>

Since the former is easier to write and read, it is almost always
preferred in practice, and you will rarely see a <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#forAll>#$forAll</a> while browsing
the CYC&reg; KB.  Note, however, that unbound variables which appear only in
the consequent of a conditional, and not in the antecedent, may have
drastic and undesired consequences.  Take, for example, the following:

<pre>
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/social-vocab.html#owns>#$owns</a> #$Fred ?WHATEBER)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/spatial-vocab.html#objectFoundInLocation>#$objectFoundInLocation</a> ?WHATEVER #$FredsHouse))
</pre>

Because of the typo, the variable ?WHATEVER will range over the
entire CYC&reg; <A HREF="glossary.html#ontology">ontology</A>.  In other
words, the assertion above states that as long as Fred owns one thing,
<i>everything</i> is located in #$FredsHouse--probably not what we
wanted.

<dt><H3><A NAME="thereExists">#$thereExists</A></H3>
<dd>

The quantifier <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#thereExists>#$thereExists</a> takes two arguments, a <A
HREF="glossary.html#variable">variable</A> and a <A
HREF="glossary.html#formula">formula</A> in which the variable appears.
In practice one uses <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#thereExists>#$thereExists</a> only in certain ways, of which the
following is a good example:

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>
      (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> ?A <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Animal>#$Animal</a>)
      (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#thereExists>#$thereExists</a> ?M
         (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#mother>#$mother</a> ?A ?M)))
</pre>

This assertion states that, for every animal, there exists at least one
object which is that animal's mother.  The object which is the animal's
mother may be an object which is already represented by a CYC&reg; <A
HREF="glossary.html#constant">constant</A>, or it may be a new object of
which CYC&reg; has no knowledge.  But unless and until it is told otherwise,
CYC&reg; will assume that the object is a new one not identical with any
"known" object.
 
<dt><H3><A NAME="thereExistExactly">#$thereExistExactly, #$thereExistAtLeast, #$thereExistAtMost</A></H3>
<dd>

These three quantifiers are similar to <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#thereExists>#$thereExists</a>, but provide
greater quantitative expressiveness.  Each of them takes three
arguments: a positive integer, a variable, and a formula in which the
variable appears.  Their meaning should be fairly self-explanatory.
Look at the following examples:

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>
      (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> ?P <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Person>#$Person</a>)

</pre>

<dt><H3><A NAME="well-formedness-2">Well-Formedness of Quantified Formulas</A></H3>

As you probably by now expect, any formula beginning with a quantifier

People writing assertions for entry into the CYC&reg; <A
HREF="glossary.html#KB">KB</A> use <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#thereExists>#$thereExists</a> quite frequently.  But
when you browse the KB, you rarely see <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#thereExists>#$thereExists</a> in an assertion.
That's because once assertions are entered into the KB, occurences of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#thereExists>#$thereExists</a> are automatically converted into <A
HREF="glossary.html#Skolem function">Skolem functions</A>.  The only
exceptions are certain cases where <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#thereExists>#$thereExists</a> is used within an

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>
      (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> ?A <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#Animal>#$Animal</a>)

<H2><A NAME="NATs">Non-Atomic Terms</A></H2>

A <A HREF="glossary.html#NAT">non-atomic term</A> (NAT) is a way of
specifying a <A HREF="glossary.html#term">term</A> as a function of some
other term(s).  Every NAT is composed of a function and one or more
arguments to that function.<p>

Consider, for example, the function <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#FruitFn>#$FruitFn</a>, which takes as an
argument a type of plant and returns the collection of the fruits of
that type of plant.  This function can be used to build the following
NATs:

<pre>
    (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#FruitFn>#$FruitFn</a> #$AppleTree)
    (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#FruitFn>#$FruitFn</a> #$PearTree)
    (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#FruitFn>#$FruitFn</a> #$WatermelonPlant)
    . . . .
</pre>

Note that there may or may not be a named CYC&reg; <A
HREF="glossary.html#constant">constant</A> corresponding to the
collection of apples (that is, a constant called #$Apple).  The NAT
(<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#FruitFn>#$FruitFn</a> #$AppleTree) provides a way of talking about this
collection even if the corresponding constant does not exist.<p>

NATs can be used anywhere a constant can be used.  One could write, for
example:

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>
       (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> ?APPLE (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#FruitFn>#$FruitFn</a> #$AppleTree))
       (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/material-vocab.html#colorOfObject>#$colorOfObject</a> ?APPLE #$RedColor))
</pre>

<dl> 

<dt><H3><A NAME="functions">Functions</A></H3>
<dd>

Since all NATs are built around functions, it's important to understand
more about them.
  
<dt><H3><A NAME="function arity">Function Arity</A></H3> 
<dd>

Like predicates, most functions have a fixed <A
HREF="glossary.html#arity">arity</A>.  A function is described as unary,
binary, ternary, quaternary, or quintary, according to whether it takes
1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 arguments.  No CycL function currently takes more than
5 arguments.<p>

A few functions do not have a fixed arity, but can take a variable
number of arguments.  Mathematical functions like <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/math-vocab.html#PlusFn>#$PlusFn</a> are one
example.  And in Cyc-10, <A HREF="glossary.html#IBQE">IBQEs</A> are now
treated as NATs in which the units of measure are functions which
can take either one or two arguments, according to whether they are
intended to denote a single value or a range.

<dt><H3><A NAME="function argument types">Function Argument Types and Result Types</A></H3>
<dd>

Functions with fixed arity are similar to predicates in that the
definition of the function must specify the type of each argument, using
the predicates <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arg1Isa>#$arg1Isa</a>, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arg2Isa>#$arg2Isa</a>, etc.<p>

Functions with no fixed arity are defined using the predicate
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#argsIsa>#$argsIsa</a>, which specifies a single type of which every argument
must be an instance.<p>

Functions differ from predicates in that they return a CYC&reg; term as a
result.  Accordingly, function definitions must also describe the type
of the result to be returned, using the predicate <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#resultIsa>#$resultIsa</a>.
Consider, for example, the function <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#GovernmentFn>#$GovernmentFn</a>:

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arity>#$arity</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#GovernmentFn>#$GovernmentFn</a> 1)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arg1Isa>#$arg1Isa</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#GovernmentFn>#$GovernmentFn</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#GeopoliticalEntity>#$GeopoliticalEntity</a>)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#resultIsa>#$resultIsa</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#GovernmentFn>#$GovernmentFn</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/organization-vocab.html#RegionalGovernment>#$RegionalGovernment</a>)
</pre>   
  
The argument to <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#GovernmentFn>#$GovernmentFn</a> must always be an instance of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#GeopoliticalEntity>#$GeopoliticalEntity</a>, and a NAT created using <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#GovernmentFn>#$GovernmentFn</a> will always
be an instance of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/organization-vocab.html#RegionalGovernment>#$RegionalGovernment</a>.  So, for instance,

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#GovernmentFn>#$GovernmentFn</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#UnitedStatesOfAmerica>#$UnitedStatesOfAmerica</a>) <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/organization-vocab.html#RegionalGovernment>#$RegionalGovernment</a>)
</pre>

<dt><H3><A NAME="IDFs vs. CDFs">#$IndividualDenotingFunction vs. #$CollectionDenotingFunction</A></H3>
<dd>

Most functions are instances of either <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#IndividualDenotingFunction>#$IndividualDenotingFunction</a> or
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#CollectionDenotingFunction>#$CollectionDenotingFunction</a>.  <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#GovernmentFn>#$GovernmentFn</a> is an example of the
former, since a NAT like (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#GovernmentFn>#$GovernmentFn</a> <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#UnitedStatesOfAmerica>#$UnitedStatesOfAmerica</a>)
denotes an <A HREF="glossary.html#individual">individual</A> government.
On the other hand, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#FruitFn>#$FruitFn</a> is an example of the latter, since a NAT
like (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#FruitFn>#$FruitFn</a> #$AppleTree) denotes the <A
HREF="glossary.html#collection">collection</A> of all apples, not an
individual apple.<p> 

The distinction between individuals and collections is an important one
in CycL.  For more on this topic, look at the constants <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Individual>#$Individual</a> and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#Collection>#$Collection</a>.<p> 

The definition of an instance of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#CollectionDenotingFunction>#$CollectionDenotingFunction</a> should
specify, not only its argument types and result type, but also the
collection that the result will have as genls.  This is done using the
predicate <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#resultGenl>#$resultGenl</a>.  For example, if the function
#$LeftPairMemberFn is defined by:

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> #$LeftPairMemberFn <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#CollectionDenotingFunction>#$CollectionDenotingFunction</a>)
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#arity>#$arity</a> #$LeftPairMemberFn 1)

then the following must be true concerning a NAT constructed from
#$LeftPairMemberFn and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/clothing-vocab.html#Shoe>#$Shoe</a>:

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> (#$LeftPairMemberFn <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/clothing-vocab.html#Shoe>#$Shoe</a>) <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/top-vocab.html#ExistingObjectType>#$ExistingObjectType</a>)

</pre>

In other words, the set of left shoes is an instance of
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/top-vocab.html#ExistingObjectType>#$ExistingObjectType</a> and a subset of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/spatial-vocab.html#LeftObject>#$LeftObject</a>.

<dt><H3><A NAME="reifiable-functions">Reifiable Functions vs.
Non-Reifiable Functions</A></H3> 
<dd>

Many CycL functions are instances of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#ReifiableFunction>#$ReifiableFunction</a>.  Each time an
instance of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#ReifiableFunction>#$ReifiableFunction</a> is used with a new set of arguments to
build a NAT, that NAT is <A
HREF="glossary.html#reification">reified</A>, that is, preserved in the
CYC&reg; <A HREF="glossary.html#ontology">ontology</A> as a <A
HREF="glossary.html#constant">constant</A>.  Constants which are reified
NATs don't start out with proper constant names, but can always be
referred to by their NAT expression.  They can later be assigned
constant names if desired.<p>

When a new reified NAT-constant is first created, CYC&reg; automatically sets
up the correspondence

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#termOfUnit>#$termOfUnit</a> NAT-CONSTANT NAT-EXPRESSION)
</pre>

where NAT-CONSTANT is the automatically created constant and
NAT-EXPRESSION is the non-atomic term that can be used to refer to it.
In the CYC&reg; web interface, such an assertion might look like this:

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#termOfUnit>#$termOfUnit</a> (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#GovernmentFn>#$GovernmentFn</a> #$Canada) (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/geography-vocab.html#GovernmentFn>#$GovernmentFn</a> #$Canada))
</pre>

It looks like the first and second arguments are the same, but that's
because, in lieu of a proper constant name for the reified NAT-constant,
the system uses the NAT expression as a print name.  If you look very
carefully at any <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#termOfUnit>#$termOfUnit</a> assertion in the web interface, you will
see that the opening parenthesis of ARG1 is a followable link (depending
on the web-browser you use, it may be underlined, or a different color),
but the opening parenthesis of ARG2 is just opaque text.  Clicking on
the opening paren of a NAT expression will display the page for the
reified NAT-constant the expression denotes.<p>

Moreover, a reified NAT can be explicitly identified with an existing
constant using the predicate <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#termOfUnit>#$termOfUnit</a>:

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#termOfUnit>#$termOfUnit</a> #$TheYear1996 (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/time-vocab.html#YearFn>#$YearFn</a> 1996))
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#termOfUnit>#$termOfUnit</a> #$Apple (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/biology-vocab.html#FruitFn>#$FruitFn</a> #$AppleTree))
</pre>

When a NAT is identified with a constant using <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#termOfUnit>#$termOfUnit</a>, the two are
asserted to be <A HREF="glossary.html#de dicto">de dicto</A>
equivalent.<p>

<A HREF="glossary.html#Skolem function">Skolem functions</A> are reifiable.<p>

Non-reifiable functions include mathematical functions like <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/math-vocab.html#PlusFn>#$PlusFn</a>.
Just because we use a NAT like (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/math-vocab.html#PlusFn>#$PlusFn</a> 59 64) doesn't mean we want
to add to the KB a unit denoting the number 123.  If we want to talk
about the number 123, we'll just refer to it directly.<p>

Also, <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/quantity-vocab.html#UnitOfMeasure>#$UnitOfMeasure</a> is not a subset of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#ReifiableFunction>#$ReifiableFunction</a>, so <A
HREF="glossary.html#IBQE">IBQEs</A> such as (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/quantity-vocab.html#Inch>#$Inch</a> 37) and (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/quantity-vocab.html#Meter>#$Meter</a>
500) are not reified when they are referred to.

<dt><H3><A NAME="quantifying into nats">Quantifying into NATs</A></H3>
<dd>

You may find, on occasion, that you want to write a rule which involves
quantifying into a NAT, that is, using a NAT which has a variable as one
of its arguments.  You can do so by following these guidelines:<p>

<ul>
<li>Use the variables ?ARG1, ?ARG2, ?ARG3, etc., to stand for any arguments over which you want to quantify.<p>
<li>Introduce a free variable which represents the result of the NAT.<p>
<li>Add a clause to the antecedent which identifies this variable with
the NAT.  To do this, use the predicate <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#equals>#$equals</a>.
</ul><p>

For example: 

<pre>
   (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#implies>#$implies</a>
      (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#and>#$and</a>
         (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#equals>#$equals</a> ?U (#$PreviouslyOwnedFn ?ARG1))
         (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> ?X ?U))
      (<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#hasAttributes>#$hasAttributes</a> ?X #$Used))
</pre>

For quantifying into NATs you should always use <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#equals>#$equals</a>, never
<a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#termOfUnit>#$termOfUnit</a>. The predicate <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#termOfUnit>#$termOfUnit</a> is used in the automatic mapping
between the system generated data structure and the original
non-atomic-term and should figure in the hand-entered assertions of
human Cyclists very rarely, if at all. <p>

Note that you cannot quantify into a NAT unless it is built on an
instance of <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#ReifiableFunction>#$ReifiableFunction</a>.



<dt><H2><A NAME="assertions">Assertions</A></H2>
<dd>

So far this document has dealt mostly with the syntax of formulas in
CycL.  This is the syntax used by people or external programs when
they assert things into a version of the CYC&reg; KB or query the KB.  Now we will shift
our focus to what formulas look like once they have been asserted into
the KB.<p>

The CYC&reg; <A HREF="glossary.html#KB">KB</A> consists of a large number of
<A HREF="glossary.html#assertion">assertions</A>.  When a formula is
successfully asserted into the KB, it is stored as one of these.
Each assertion is composed of a number of elements:

<UL>
<LI>a <A HREF="glossary.html#formula">formula</A>
<LI>a <A HREF="glossary.html#mt">microtheory</A>   
<LI>a <A HREF="glossary.html#tv">truth value</A> 
<LI>a <A HREF="glossary.html#direction">direction</A> (or <A HREF="glossary.html#access level">access level</A>)
<LI>a <A HREF="glossary.html#support">support</A>
</UL>

We'll discuss each of these and point out where they come from.  It's
important that you be familiar with all of them:

<dl>

<dt><H3><A NAME="assertion formulas">Formulas</A></H3>
<dd>

You are already familiar with formulas--they are the
<A HREF="glossary.html#CycLForm">CycFormulas</A>
we use to state things in the CYC&reg; KB.

<dt><H3><A NAME="microtheories">Microtheories</A></H3>
<dd>

Every assertion is contained in some <A
HREF="glossary.html#mt">microtheory</A>.  A particular formula may be
asserted into (or concluded in) more than one microtheory; when this is
the case, there will be an assertion which has that formula in each of
those microtheories.  The largest number of assertions are currently in
the <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#BaseKB>#$BaseKB</a>.<p>

Microtheories are covered in more detail <A HREF="../course/contexts-basic-module.html">here</A>, as well as in the constant vocabulary, under <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#Microtheory>#$Microtheory</a>.

Where does the microtheory information on assertions come from?  That
depends on the origin of the assertion.  If an assertion is added to
the KB by the inference engine as the result of firing a rule, the
inference engine code decides what microtheory the conclusion should be
added in and records it at add time.  If an assertion is the result of a
person or external program asserting a formula into the KB, at that time
the asserter must specify which microtheory the formula is to go in.
Some interfaces for knowledge entry may not require the user to specify
a microtheory for new assertions, and will then either try to choose the
right one or will use <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/mt-vocab.html#BaseKB>#$BaseKB</a> as a default.  If you use such an
interface make sure you know what the default behavior is.

<dt><H3><A NAME="truth values">Truth Values</A></H3>
<dd>

Attached to every assertion is a truth value that indicates its degree
of truth.  CycL contains five possible truth values, of which the most
common are <A HREF="glossary.html#default true">default true</A> and <A
HREF="glossary.html#monotonically true">monotonically true</A>.<p>

Assertions that are monotonically true are held to be true in every
case, that is, for every possible set of bindings to the universally
quantified variables (if any) in the assertion, and cannot be
overridden.  In the case of a monotonically true assertion with
universally quantified variables in its formula, if an object is found
for which the assertion is not true, an error is signalled.  In the case
of a ground assertion that is monotonically true, if the negation of
that formula is ever asserted or arrived at during inference (in the
same microtheory), an error is signalled.<p>

Assertions that are default true, in contrast, are held to be true in
most cases, and can be overridden.  If the negation of an existing
ground, default assertion is asserted in the same microtheory, or is
arrived at through inference, no error is signalled.  Instead, the
<A HREF="glossary.html#argumentation">argumentation</A> mechanism is
invoked to decide what the final truth value of the assertion will
be.<p>
  
By default, <A HREF="glossary.html#GAF">GAFs</A> which begin with the
predicates <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> and <a href=/cycdoc/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#genls>#$genls</a> are monotonically true, while all
other assertions (including <A HREF="glossary.html#rule">rules</A>) are
default true.

<dt><H3><A NAME="directions">Directions</A></H3>
<dd>

<A HREF="glossary.html#direction">Direction</A> is a value associated
with every assertion that determines when inferencing involving that
assertion should be performed.  There are three possible values for
direction: <A HREF="glossary.html#forward">forward</A>, <A
HREF="glossary.html#backward">backward</A>, and <A HREF="glossary.html#code">code</A>.  Inferencing involving assertions with direction forward is performed at <A
HREF="glossary.html#ASSERT">assert</A> time (that is, when a new assertion
is added to the KB), while inferencing involving assertions with
direction backward is postponed until a query occurs and that query allows
backward inference.  By default, <A
HREF="glossary.html#GAF">GAFs</A> have direction forward, while <A
HREF="glossary.html#rule">rules</A> have direction backward.  Only in
very special cases should rules have direction forward.
<p>
Assertions with direction code are not used in normal inference at all; instead, special HL
modules have been written to supplant the need for inference using the
assertion itself.  Code assertions cannot be edited via the HTML interface.
<p>
One way of viewing directions is as a hierarchy of "when it gets used" :
<ul>
<li> :code <br>
Assertions declared :code are exhaustively supported directly by HL modules.
<li> :forward <br>
Assertions declared forward are used exhaustively in forward inference.
All :code assertions are also used implicitly at this level since the
HL modules supplanting them are used here.
<li> :backward <br>
Assertions declared backward are only used in backward inference.
All :forward assertions are also used at this level, and the HL modules
supplanting :code assertions are again used at this level.
</ul>
<p>
Older CYC&reg; documentation refers to "access levels" rather than to
direction.  Access level 0 is equivalent to direction forward, while
access level 4 or higher is equivalent to direction backward.

<dt><H3><A NAME="support">Supports</A></H3>
<dd>

Attached to every assertion is a <A HREF="#support">support</A>, which consists
of one or more <A
HREF="glossary.html#justification">justifications</A> which form the
support for the presence of the assertion in the KB.  In many cases, at
least one of the supporting justifications is <A
HREF="glossary.html#local">local</A>, indicating that the assertion was
added to the <A HREF="glossary.html#KB">KB</A> from an outside source
(most commonly, a human <A HREF="glossary.html#KEer">KEer</A>).  In
other cases, a supporting justification is a <A
HREF="glossary.html#source">source</A> which indicates the assertion was
inferred and which outlines the final step of some <A
HREF="glossary.html#argument">argument</A>, or chain of reasoning,
which supports the assertion.<p>

The support is the one element of an assertion which need not be
specified by the KEer when performing knowledge entry.  It is created
and updated automatically.  However, supports can be displayed by
KB browsing tools.<p>
