<p>
Renaming and/or killing  constants in the KB should be done sparingly and with caution.  After a constant has been created, there is possibly a short window of time where a rename or kill would not have much affect on others' work, but after that renames or kill should not be done unless absolutely necessary.
<p>
If you do decide to rename or kill a constant, certain ones have special circumstances which will not allow them 
to be renamed/killed.  These circumstances are listed below.  Click on the link to find out how to tell if they apply to your chosen constant.
<ul>
<li><a href="#code">The constant is mentioned in code.</a>
<li><a href="#public">The constant is a public constant.</a>
</ul>

<p>

<h4><a name="code">How to know if a constant is mentioned in code:</a></h4>

Look at the constant in the KB Browser.  Click on "Definitional Info" in the Term Index.  If the constant is mentioned in code, the word "CODE" will appear in bold under the constant name in the constant display pane.  Constants mentioned in code cannot be renamed or killed (thus the "Rename" and "Kill" links for constants mentioned in code are not highlighted).


<h4><a name="public">How to know if a constant is a public constant:</a></h4>

Look at the constant in the KB Browser.  Click on "Definitional Info" in the Term Index. The constant will be an instance of <a href=/cycdoc-int/vocab/doc-vocab.html#PublicConstant>#$PublicConstant</a> in the KB (i.e., the assertion (<a href=/cycdoc-int/vocab/fundamental-vocab.html#isa>#$isa</a> constant <a href=/cycdoc-int/vocab/doc-vocab.html#PublicConstant>#$PublicConstant</a>) will be true).

<h4><a name="comment">How to deal with constants mentioned in documentation in the KB:</a></h4>

When renames occur, any references to the old constant name in <a href=/cycdoc-int/vocab/doc-vocab.html#comment>#$comment</a> strings, etc. will become stale.  Similarly for any references left behind after a constant kill. Review specs and other related constants of the renamed or killed 
term to see if there comments mention the changed term. The term will appear not appear underlined, as it would 
if it still existed with that name in the KB.
