<p><b>What's wrong with making a collection called #$Brother?</b></p>

<p>Suppose Billy and Peter are brothers, and we want to tell Cyc this by asserting the following two facts:</p>

<p>
<tt><pre>
(isa Billy Brother)
(isa Peter Brother)
</pre></tt>
</p>

<p>Later, we learn of two other brothers, Jack and Bobby. We tell Cyc about them in the same way:</p>

<p>
<tt><pre>
(isa Jack Brother)
(isa Bobby Brother)
</pre></tt>
</p>

<p>Now, to ask Cyc for instances of #$Brother, we ASK:</p>

<p>
<tt><pre>
(isa ?WHO Brother)
</pre></tt>
</p>

<p>And we get the answer:</p>

<p>
<tt><pre>
4 Answers     ?WHO 

-------------------
 
[Explain #1]  Billy 
[Explain #2]  Peter 
[Explain #3]  Jack 
[Explain #4]  Bobby 
</pre></tt>
</p>

<p>So, Cyc thinks that they are all brothers, because there is no relation that distinguishes which of them are related to which others.</p>
